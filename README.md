# proxy_handler

## Purpose

A quick demonstration of routing requests concurrently to other
endpoints

## Concurrency Test

There's a small test where you can test the concurrency of the script.
Take care to not execute it with the main.proxyRequest() intact.
Commenting out lines 25-35 will save google and reddit from a deluge of
requests.
